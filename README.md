# Accelerating Human-AI Co-adaptation (Multi-agent Group 12)

This repository is for Accelerating Human-AI Co-adaptation. For initial setup refer to 'https://github.com/VT-Collab/RILI_co-adaptation/tree/main' which is the main repository for the paper "Learning Latent Representations to Co-Adapt to Humans" [http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09586].

In this repository we include codes for the two strategies:
- RILI vs SAC
- Multiple Agents
